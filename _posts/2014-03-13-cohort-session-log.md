### @agooniz feedback
FINALLY! I've figured out what I was asked to do! Special thanks to John for guiding me. Shamiul also deserves some credit for convincing me to join this course.

From this course I do not expect to be the perfect ROR DEV but I do expect to understand the logics behind ROR coding and knowledge of some development. I know people spend years and years studying one subject to be the master at it and they do not succed. I can just go on and on about this and turn this feedback into an actual article to be published somewhere on the web but for now I will stop here... Thanks JD.

### @shammowla feedback

Feedback #2 ;)

### @jcdavison feedback

it is tough to be in class in learn when I'm a virtual person

### @railstutor feedback

I know that I need to have a good internet connection before class starts, but I didn't know that where I was yesterday was no good until class started, I don't want that to happen again.

### remember, some of the point of my challenges is to teach you specific skills, some of the point of my challenges is to make you struggle, learn how to learn and learn how to solve your own problems with docs.
